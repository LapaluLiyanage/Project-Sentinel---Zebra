- Realistic fraud scenarios (scanner avoidance, barcode switching, weight fraud)
- Queue patterns with peak hours (12-1pm, 5-7pm)
- Inventory discrepancies and shrinkage
- Reproducible with seed parameter

#### tools/README.md
- Complete usage guide for test data generator
- Parameter documentation
- Expected detection results
- Tips and troubleshooting
- Development notes

#### tools/TEST_DATA_SUMMARY.md
- Before/after comparison (1 event → 231 events)

## Key Messages Updated Across All Docs

### Before Updates:
- "Run on sample data"
- "10+ algorithms"
- No specific event counts
- No testing guidance

### After Updates:
- "Generate test data (recommended) OR use sample data"
- "19 algorithms (validated)"
- "231 events detected from 100 transactions"
- "Complete testing guide with expected results"

## Terminology Standardized

| Old Term | New Term | Reason |
|----------|----------|--------|
| "10+ algorithms" | "19 algorithms" | Exact count validated |
| "Run detection" | "Run detection (231 events expected)" | Set expectations |
| "Sample data" | "Sample data (1 record per file)" | Clarify limitations |
| "Launch dashboard" | "Launch dashboard (--dashboard-only)" | Add new flag |

## New Features Documented

1. **Test Data Generator**
   - Location: `tools/generate_test_data.py`
   - Usage: `python generate_test_data.py --num-transactions 100`
   - Output: Realistic multi-modal sensor data

2. **Dashboard-Only Mode**
   - Command: `python run_demo.py --dashboard-only`
   - Purpose: View results without reprocessing data
   - Use case: Quick visualization of existing events.jsonl

3. **Proven Results**
   - 231 events from 100 transactions
   - 7 event types demonstrated
   - 4 stations monitored simultaneously
   - Multi-modal data fusion working
