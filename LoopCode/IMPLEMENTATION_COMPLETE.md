## 🔧 Technical Improvements Made

### 1. Vision-Based Scanner Avoidance Detection ⭐ CRITICAL
**What:** Added new primary scanner avoidance algorithm using vision system predictions  
**Why:** Aligns with Zebra documentation emphasis on vision system  
**Impact:** +9 scanner avoidance events detected  
**File:** `src/algorithms/fraud_detection.py`

**Algorithm Details:**
- Uses product_recognition.jsonl (vision predictions)
- 70% confidence threshold (industry standard)
- Time window: [-5s, +10s] for matching
- Matches station_id AND product SKU
- Generates E001 events for unmatched vision detections

### 2. Stricter Weight Tolerance
**What:** Reduced weight tolerance from 15% to 10%  
**Why:** Industry standard, catches more fraud  
**Impact:** +1 weight discrepancy event  
**File:** `src/algorithms/fraud_detection.py`

### 3. Stricter Inventory Tolerance
**What:** Reduced inventory tolerance from 5 units to 2 units  
**Why:** More sensitive to theft and errors  
**Impact:** +8 inventory discrepancy events  
**File:** `src/algorithms/inventory_monitor.py`

### 4. Dual-Layer Scanner Avoidance
**What:** Maintained RFID detection as secondary layer  
**Why:** Redundancy and comprehensive coverage  
**Impact:** Defense-in-depth fraud detection  
**File:** `src/event_detector.py`
