## Judge Run Command

Judges will `cd evidence/executables/` and run **one command** on Ubuntu 24.04:

```bash
python3 run_demo.py --data-dir /path/to/test/data --dataset-type test
```

For the final dataset:

```bash
python3 run_demo.py --data-dir /path/to/final/data --dataset-type final
```

**Optional - Dashboard only mode (if events.jsonl already exists):**
```bash
python3 run_demo.py --dashboard-only
```

### What the Script Does

The `run_demo.py` script automates the entire analysis workflow:

1. **Installs dependencies** - Automatically installs pandas, streamlit, plotly
2. **Loads input data** - Reads all JSONL and CSV files from the data directory
3. **Runs detection algorithms** - Executes all 19 detection algorithms
4. **Generates events.jsonl** - Creates output in the correct format
5. **Copies to evidence/** - Automatically places files in evidence/output/test or evidence/output/final
6. **Creates summary report** - Generates detailed statistics with event counts

### Optional: Launch Dashboard

To view the interactive dashboard after detection:

```bash
python3 run_demo.py --data-dir /path/to/data --launch-dashboard
```

Or launch dashboard independently:
```bash
python3 run_demo.py --dashboard-only
```

## System Requirements

- **Python:** 3.9 or higher
- **RAM:** 2GB minimum
- **Disk:** 500MB for dependencies and output
- **Internet:** Required for initial dependency installation only

## Output Structure

After running, the script creates:

```
evidence/executables/results/
├── events.jsonl              # Main output file (231+ events with test data)
└── summary_report.txt        # Statistical summary with event distribution

evidence/output/
├── test/
│   └── events.jsonl         # Test dataset results (copy of results/events.jsonl)
└── final/
    └── events.jsonl         # Final dataset results (copy of results/events.jsonl)
```

### Sample Output Statistics

With generated test data (100 transactions):
```
Total Events: 231
Event Types: 7 (E000, E002, E003, E004, E007, E008, E009)
Stations: 4 (SCC1, SCC2, SCC3, SCC4)
Fraud Events: 34 (barcode switching + weight discrepancies)
Queue Issues: 39 (staffing needs + station actions)
Inventory: 14 discrepancies detected
```

With competition data: Results will vary based on actual data content.

4. Success Operation Detection - Identify normal transactions

### Queue Analysis (5 algorithms)
5. Queue Threshold Analysis - Monitor queue length
6. Wait Time Threshold Analysis - Monitor customer wait times
7. Staffing Requirements Prediction - Predict staffing needs
8. Station Status Management - Recommend opening/closing stations
9. Queue Trend Analysis - Analyze patterns over time

### Inventory Monitoring (5 algorithms)
10. Inventory Reconciliation - Compare expected vs actual stock
11. Stock Level Monitoring - Low stock alerts
12. Inventory Velocity Analysis - Calculate turnover rates
13. Shrinkage Detection - Detect unexplained losses
14. Reorder Point Calculation - Optimal reorder timing

### Anomaly Detection (5 algorithms)
15. System Downtime Detection - Detect crashes and gaps
